	RESULTS
	{
		default = The crew floats around the lab, observing the results of this most interesting, yet unnamed experiment.
		default = The crew is floating around aimlessly, enjoying the wonder of space.  This is most definitely not what we are paying them for...
		default = The crew jazzercises to help combat the effects of long-duration space missions.
		default = The crew is loving the feeling of weightlessness.

		KerbinInSpaceLow = The crew takes time to stop and smell the roses, observing their smell has changed significantly after being grown in the low gravity environment.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The crew observes a common foodborne virus, finding that it becomes significantly more virulent in low gravity.
		KerbinInSpace = The crew engages in various experiments involving small, furry creatures.

		MunInSpaceLow = We've been lied to, according to sensors there's nothing here but dust and rocks.  I was promised cheese!
		MunInSpaceHigh = Kerbals still hate brushing their teeth, even in micro-gravity.

		MinmusInSpaceLow = Consuming food is considerably more difficult in space.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = The crew studies the deliciousness of various minty frozen desserts...

		GillyInSpace = Snacks are more appreciated in the weightlessness of space.
		
		MohoInSpace = The experiment seems to react violently to the micro-gravity environment.
		
		EveInSpace = Plants grow far quicker in space.
		
		DunaInSpace = In the reduced gravity, the sapling has started to grow an eye and tentacles.
		
		IkeInSpace = Exercise is important for the health of spacebound Kerbals.
		
		DresInSpace = The test subject blinks more quickly in this environment.
		
		JoolInSpace = The subject is mysteriously pulled to the side of the container.
		
		LaytheInSpace = The crew seems to do its tasks better. What causes this is unknown.
		
		VallInSpace = The moon's resonance with Jool is throwing off the results.
		
		TyloInSpace = Performing science experiments is more pleasurable in this gravitational field.
		
		BopInSpace = The plants in the cabin are pointing to the moon's pole.
		
		PolInSpace = The subject's hairs are standing up straight for some reason.
		
		EelooInSpace = The crew is too homesick to do any experiments, which is interesting in itself.

		SunInSpace = The crew is in awe at our insignificance as Kerbin shrinks away to just another speck of dust floating through space... 
		SunInSpaceLow = Is it hot in here?  It seems really hot in here.  Maybe we're too close to the giant ball of flaming gas?
